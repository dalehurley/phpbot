# Answer Factual Question

Answer the question using available knowledge. If the answer is uncertain or may be beyond the knowledge cutoff date, state that explicitly. Format the answer clearly with relevant details such as names, dates, scores, or locations as applicable.

## Notes

- State confidence level when the answer may be incomplete or outdated
- For very recent events, note that information may not be available

## Example

```
who won the superbowl 2026
when did the Berlin Wall fall
what is the capital of Australia
who invented the telephone
what happened at the Battle of Hastings
```
